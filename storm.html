    <section class="FAQS">
        <p class="dmsans quote spacing">He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided.</p>
        <p class="dmsans answer spacing">It wasn’t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table – Samsa was a travelling salesman – and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.</p>
        <p class="dmsans question spacing">Q: Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad?</p>
        <p class="dmsans answer spacing">A: It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>
        <p class="dmsans answer spacing">For me, that was really about two things: learning how to manage and grow people who were naturally talented and defining what I thought a strategy department could and should be, which involved getting out from behind a computer and back into the world to find original insights and ultimately make decisions that give clients an advantage. My time at R/GA was a continuation of that but across multiple disciplines and at a global scale. I feel extremely grateful for my time at both agencies.</p>
        
        <div class="blockquote spacing">
          <p>However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="dmsans question spacing">Q: Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home?</p>
        <p class="dmsans answer spacing">A: Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell! ” He felt a slight itch. I feel extremely grateful for my time at both agencies.</p>
        <p class="dmsans question spacing">Q: And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her?</p>
        <p class="dmsans answer spacing">A: But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.</p>
        <p class="dmsans answer spacing">A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
        <p class="dmsans question spacing">Q: I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now?</p>
        <p class="dmsans answer spacing">A: It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>
