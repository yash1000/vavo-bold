                  He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
                  little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and
                  divided.

                  It wasn’t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a
                  little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar
                  walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the
                  table – Samsa was a travelling salesman – and above it there
                  hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated
                  magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.

                  For me, that was really about two things: learning how to
                  manage and grow people who were naturally talented and
                  defining what I thought a strategy department could and should
                  be, which involved getting out from behind a computer and back
                  into the world to find original insights and ultimately make
                  decisions that give clients an advantage. My time at R/GA was
                  a continuation of that but across multiple disciplines and at
                  a global scale. I feel extremely grateful for my time at both
                  agencies.

                  A: Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this
                  takes much more effort than doing your own business at home,
                  and on top of that there’s the curse of travelling, worries
                  about making train connections, bad and irregular food,
                  contact with different people all the time so that you can

                  didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed
                  her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into
