                  Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing
                  your own business at home, and on top of that there’s the
                  curse of travelling, worries about making train connections,
                  bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the
                  time so that you can never get to know anyone or become
                  friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!

                  When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she
                  had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown
                  Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the
                  subline of her own road, then she continued her way.

                  A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul,
                  like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my
                  whole heart.

                  When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and
                  the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
                  foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal.

                  Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the
                  countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
                  Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of
                  the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
                  Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary
                  regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted
                  parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

                  Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind
                  texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a
                  small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to
                  leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her
                  not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
                  Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
                  didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial
                  into the belt and made herself on the way.
